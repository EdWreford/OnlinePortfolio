                        CV Checker is a web application I built to help users optimise their CVs with confidence. 
                        It analyses uploaded or pasted CVs and compares them against a specific job description, 
                        highlighting missing skills or keywords and giving a coverage score. Users receive clear, 
                        actionable feedback so they can tailor their CVs to better match the roles they are applying for.

                        Built with Python and Flask on the backend, CV Checker uses <strong>spaCy</strong> for natural language 
                        processing to extract meaningful keywords and perform conceptual matching. Users can upload PDFs 
                        or DOCX files, and the application automatically extracts text using <strong>PyPDF2</strong> and 
                        <strong>python-docx</strong>. The comparison includes conceptual synonyms to ensure that 
                        relevant skills are recognised even if phrased differently.

                        The interface is clean and responsive, designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth 
                        experience across devices. The results include a visual coverage score, colour-coded feedback 
                        for covered and missing keywords, and a side-by-side layout for CV and job description input. 
                        Modular design and reusable components make the application maintainable and scalable for 
                        future enhancements.
