                    Vetra is a task management app designed to make organization simple, flexible, and reliable. 
                    It goes beyond traditional to-do lists by allowing users to create tasks with start and end 
                    dates, durations, and repeat intervals, so whether it's a one-off reminder or a weekly routine, 
                    Vetra adapts to individual workflows. Tasks can be customized with colors and icons for quick 
                    recognition, and appear in both a streamlined list view and an interactive calendar view, 
                    giving users multiple ways to manage their time. Local notifications remind users 30 minutes 
                    before each task begins, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.

                    From a development perspective, Vetra is built with Flutter, providing a smooth, consistent 
                    experience across iOS and Android. Task data is stored locally using Hive, a lightweight 
                    NoSQL database, chosen for its speed and offline capabilities. This ensures instant access 
                    to data without relying on network connectivity, and makes the app responsive even with a 
                    large task history. For notifications, Vetra integrates Flutter Local Notifications with 
                    WorkManager to schedule alerts in the background â€” even for repeating tasks when the app 
                    isn't running.

                    The app's interface has been carefully designed with scalability in mind. Features like 
                    reusable form widgets, tappable task boxes, and modular detail screens make the codebase 
                    clean and maintainable. With support for light and dark mode, Vetra offers both a polished 
                    user experience and a solid technical foundation, showcasing thoughtful design paired with 
                    practical engineering decisions.
