                    This project takes the familiar challenge of Sudoku into three dimensions. 
                    Instead of a flat 9x9 board, puzzles are generated to make a cube, with numbers 
                    required to be unique across rows, columns, and subcubes. The result is a 
                    deeper and more complex logic puzzle, offering a new way to experience 
                    Sudoku for enthusiasts looking for a twist. You can see some instructions and also
                    a visual representation of what a 3D Sudoku does look like, by only being given multiple 
                    2D Sudokus.

                    The application is built in Java using Swing for the interface. 
                    The puzzle generator ensures valid solutions by filling the cube 
                    with a backtracking algorithm, then selectively removing numbers 
                    to create playable puzzles. It does this by removing one number, 
                    then checking that the empty square only has one possible solution, 
                    then if there are any other empty squares it does the same process. 
                    If at some point there is no definitive solution, it will try to 
                    remove another number. Difficulty levels control how many 
                    cells are removed, balancing challenge with solvability.

                    The visual interface presents the cube as multiple 2D slices, 
                    allowing players to solve one layer at a time while still 
                    respecting the global 3D rules. The homescreen helps show what 
                    a 3D cube will look like when being represented by 2D Sudokus, 
                    how they are orientated onto the cube. With support for both 4x4x4 
                    and 9x9x9 grids, the app scales from beginner-friendly puzzles to highly 
                    advanced challenges.
